Hey, I'm Rachel, the sometimes zombie potato. And this is my eclectic personal blog. See, I'm interested in so many different things that I wanted a place to write about whatever I felt like. No niche focus, just whatever I was inspired to write about. 

Just to give you an idea about the sorts of topics that might come up, here's some stuff I'm interested in (subject to change). I have no idea if I'll write about all of them or not. Who knows. 

### 10 Things I'm Interested In
(in no particular order)

1. Pets/Animals (I have 6: 2 dogs, 3 cats, 1 rabbit.)
2. DIY Crafts (knitting, scarpbooking, anything else that seems fun)
3. Learning Spanish
4. Recipes and weight loss
5. History
6. Natural remedies
7. English language and grammar
8. Technology
9. Productivity
10. Christianity and philosophy
