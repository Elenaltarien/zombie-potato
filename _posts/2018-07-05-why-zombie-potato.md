> Why in the world would you call your blog Zombie Potato?

That's what you are thinking, right? I can't really blame you; it's a weird name. But it's an awesome name and there's a story behind it. 

### The INTJ

As an INTJ, I do my best work when I have time to process and organize all the information and demands that gets thrown at me during a work day. Emails, notes, and projects need to be reviewed and all action items put on a to-do list or scheduled on the calendar. Trying to update my to-do lists  and calendar on the fly during the action of the day has never really worked well for me. I need quiet time with just me, my computer, my planner, my lists, and preferably a cup of coffee in order for me to effectively organize and plan everything that needs my attention.

If I don't get into processing mode enough, I get very stressed. You see, until I actually get action items onto a list and organized out in the external world (instead of just in my head) I feel like I need to be doing them all *right now*. And of course I can't possibly due **everything** right now so I start to feel overwhelmed. If this goes on for too long, I feel like my brain shorts out till it can be rebooted.

### The Zombie Potato

So where does the zombie potato figure into all this?

Well, the other day at work I was inundated with tasks that needed my attention but couldn't be handled immediately. I've been busier than normal at work and hadn't had time to get into processing mode all week. By the time I got home from work that day, I felt like an exhausted mush brained person. 

While trying to decide on what to eat for dinner, I told my husband I felt like a potato cause I had no energy. Or a zombie cause my brain felt like mush. And he said "A zombie potato?" It was perfect. That's exactly how I felt. Thus the "zombie potato" phrase was born. 

So, that's the story behind the name of the blog. It was funny when it happened. I still think it's funny but it might be a "you had to be there" kinda thing. Either way, I felt I should tell the story behind the name of the blog.
